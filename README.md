# Little-Helper
## A small menu driven python program to open certain application in your os. PS: It speaks ;)
Currently it only supports four applications namely:
1. Chrome
2. Notepad
3. VS Code
4. Jupyter Notebook
More functionalities will be added soon
Before running the program make sure that you have successfully installed python3 and the applications mentioned above in your PC and make sure that the environment variables (path) has been set for the above applications.
Also you need pyttsx3 : a text to speech python library to make this program run successfully.
If you dont have pyttsx3 installed in your system, execute the following command in command prompt:
pip install pyttsx3
Happy Learning!
